This repo contains my submissions for the ALX-T Data Analysis Nanodegree Program

### Project 1  
Investigate a Dataset was the first project in this course, where I had to analyse the Kaggle's [noshowappointment](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments) dataset to understand what factors influenced if patients would show up for apointments they made, or not.  

### Project 2  
In this project I was expected to scrape data from the [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) account on Twitter using a developer API, and then analyse the data extracted to understand what factors were influencing the ratings for different dog pictures.  

### Final Project  
My capstone project for this course was the analysis of the [San Fransisco Ford GoBike dataset](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38_201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv), a ride-sharing service, in order to understand what factors influenced the duration of trips made.
