# ALX-Data-Analysis-Nanodegree-Program
This repo contains my submissions for the ALX-T Data Analysis Nanodegree Program

<li>**Project 1:** Investigate a Dataset was the first project in this course, where I had to analyse the Kaggle's [noshowappointment](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments) dataset to understand what factors influenced if patients would show up for apointments they made, or not.</li>
<li>**Project 2:** In this project I was expected to scrape data from the We-Rate-Dogs account on Twitter using a developer API, and then analyse the data extracted to understand what factors were influencing the ratings for different dog pictures.</li>
<li>**Final Project:** My capstone project for this course was the analysis of the San Fransisco Ford GoBike dataset, a ride-sharing service, in order to understand what factors influenced the duration of trips made.</li>
